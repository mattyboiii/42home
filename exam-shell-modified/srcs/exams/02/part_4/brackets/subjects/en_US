Write a program that takes an indefinite number of strings in its arguments. For each argument the program outputs "OK" followed by a newline character if the expression is correctly bracketed, otherwise it outputs "Error" followed by a newline character.
The characters considered as "square brackets" are square brackets "(" and ")", square brackets "[" and "]", and curly brackets "{" and "}". All other characters are simply ignored. The opening bracket must always be closed by a good closing bracket in the correct order. A string that does not contain brackets is considered a string in the correct brackets.
If there are no arguments, the program should output only a new string.
Examples :

$> ./brackets '(johndoe)' | cat -e
OK$
$> ./brackets '([)]' | cat -e
Error$
$> ./brackets '' '{[(0 + 0)(1 + 1)](3*(-1)){()}}' | cat -e
OK$
OK$
$> ./brackets | cat -e
$
$>
