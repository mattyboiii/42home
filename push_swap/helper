below is a struct which I am using to contain a stack of numbers and other details. I
am using these stack in the push_swap project. However, this means that when I call
fuctions. I have to always hand in both stacks. Am i able to use another struct which I
can call stack->a or somthing like that. Which can have both stack a and b? So i could just
hand in rev_check(t_node **stacks) somthing like that.


typedef struct s_stack_node
{
	long				num;
	long				pos;
	char				stack[2];
	int					chunk;
	int					div;
	struct s_stack_node	*prev;
	struct s_stack_node	*next;
}	t_node;

int	rev_checks(t_node **a, t_node **b, t_node *last, t_node *hold)

if gold is not set. Set it.
if gold is set. set temp and compare.
