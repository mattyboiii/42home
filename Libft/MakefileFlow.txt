ok so, the invokation of my current makefile if I run make will.

1. run the default rule all. creating the file libft.a as the variable $(NAME)
2. it will then run the first (in this case only) specifier rule matching the default rule prerequisite which is rule 2.
3. while running rule # 2 it will notice that the $(OBJ) varialbe is being called, but can not be completed because $(OBJDIR) has not been made and neither has $(SRC). eg in line 16 of my makefile " 16 OBJ = $(patsubst $(SRCDIR)/%.c, $(OBJDIR)/%.o, $(SRC))".
4. The Makefile will then look for any missing involvement for the function. This will then have the makefile create both $(SRC) and $(OBJ) lists.
5. Then it will trigger rule 6, which is a pattern rule telling the program how to make $(OBJDIR) if it does not exist. Then compile
