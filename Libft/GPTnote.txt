I have a directory called libft.

inside libft is

ft_isalnum.c
ft_isalpha.c
ft_isascii.c
ft_isdigit.c
ft_isprint.c
ft_memset.c
ft_strelen.c
libft.h

inside libft.h is

#ifndef LIBFT_H
#define LIBFT_H

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int ft_isalpha(int c);
int ft_isdigit(int c);
int	ft_isalnum(int c);
int	ft_isascii(int c);
int	ft_isprint(int c);

size_t	ft_strlen(const char *s);

void	ft_memset(void *s, int c, size_t len);


#endif



- you must submit a Makefile which will compile your
source files to the required output with the flags -Wall, -Wextra and -Werror, use
cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

- Your Makefile must at least contain the rules $(NAME), all, clean, fclean and
re.

- If your project allows you to use your libft, you must copy its sources and its
associated Makefile in a libft folder with its associated Makefile. Your projectâ€™s
Makefile must compile the library by using its Makefile, then compile the project.

I am confused what this means. I have little experience with Makefile's
