User
ets say I have a struct which I am turning into linked lists. 

typedef struct s_list
{
	char	*buffer;
	struct	s_list *next;
}		t_list;

and I hand in a new node. lstadd_back(**lst, *new)

lst 300

**lst 200

*lst 201
{
	buffer = 203 "hello "
	next NULL;
}


new 100
{
	buffer = 101 "bob"
	next NULL;
}



can you visualise this for me. Understanding any numbers i use are metaphorical memory addresses. i understand a char string = "sup" is visualised as. 

100	101	102	103
string	[s]	[u]	[p]
