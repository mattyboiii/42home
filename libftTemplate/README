libft. 

Is a folder with an updated makefile which uses a wildcard to run on all files inside of a src directory. The files can also be inside of seperate folders. Then when it compiles them, it will do so into seperate folders. eg. 

src
-- ft_printf
------file1.c
------file2.c
-- random.c
-- random1.c

obj
-- ft_printf
------file1.o
------file2.o
-- random.o
-- random1.o

It also has no lst functions or structs, so that they can be created/modified to suit the specific project. I also prefer doubly linked list's now. And the bonus did not consider this. 



LibftWithBouns
is simply the clean norminette friendly version of the libft with the bonus so it includes all of the lst functoins.
